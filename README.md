# ChenFly
Hello everyone, this project mainly introduces how to make a drone flight control from scratch. This project will continue to add flight control functions in the form of chapters.

## Chapter1
This chapter mainly introduces the entire flight control software framework through an STM32 minimum system. The software framework of this project does not use an operating system and is implemented using scheduler, making the code simpler and easier to understand.

## Chapter2
This chapter adds a switching power supply circuit, and the battery voltage can be read through the ADC of STM32.
